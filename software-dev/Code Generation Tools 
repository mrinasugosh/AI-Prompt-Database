### Reason to Use

Enlisting ChatGPT's assistance in automating code generation tools can significantly improve a developer's productivity and speed up the development process. ChatGPT can suggest the most appropriate code templates, frameworks, and libraries based on the developer's requirements, reducing the time spent on manual coding. This also ensures code consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors in the final product.
